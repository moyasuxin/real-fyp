9702,1276,SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT ENGINEERING,EC 3290,"Software requirements engineering is the systematic process of defining, documenting, and managing what a software system needs to do and the constraints it must operate under. It involves gathering requirements from stakeholders like customers and users, analyzing these needs, and creating a clear document, such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), which serves as a blueprint for the entire development process. Key activities include requirements elicitation, analysis, specification, and management to ensure the final product meets its intended purpose. ",A,3.0,,2025-11-17T08:09:13.102656+00:00
