CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
A problem statement is a concise statement of the problems which initiate/spark the research questions or design ideas. Some of the points that could be highlighted are:
•
What is the issue that we want to address (problem or question)?
•
Why need to address the issues?
•
How the project can solve the issues?
•
Who get benefits from the project?
Objective sets a clear goal of what we want to accomplish by doing the research work. It SHOULD NOT INCLUDE the objective of doing the Final Year Project (e.g. to learn how to manage a project etc.). Student should only state the technical objective of the project (e.g. to evaluate the performance of the design, to test a hypotheses, to study the relationship between variable x and variable y etc.). Use measurable action verbs when defining an objective (e.g. define, design, identify, describe, analyze, evaluate etc).
Scope sets a clear boundary (time, geography, environment, function etc.) of our work to provide a common understanding of the project among stakeholders (in FYP the stakeholders are students, lecturer, panels etc.). Scope makes our project achievable and realistic by defining the limits and constrains of the study.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review discussed published information in a particular subject area. The purpose of a literature review is to summarize and synthesize the ideas of others. When we write a literature review, it usually consists of 3 main sections:
•
Introduction section that describe the topic of the review.
•
Body section which contains the discussion of sources.
•
Conclusions from the discussion of sources and recommendations (if any). The main point in the conclusion of the literature review would be the clarification and emphasis of the gaps (unexplored/unsolved problem in the field) and the contribution of the student’s project.
The discussion of the sources could be arranged chronologically, thematically or methodologically or in combination of any of them. In the discussion, students should:
•
Be clear of the items that need to be discussed. It can be a variable or a technique or different design decisions.
•
Make comparisons and give technical comments. Summary of the comparison could be tabulated or shown in graphs to clarify the differences.

CHAPTER 3: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (APPROPRIATE TITLE RELATED TO RESEARCH)
Methodology is the part where we design and execute our research. We design our research methodology by asking the following questions:
•
What is the objective of the study? (e.g. given a new design idea, we want to evaluate the performance of the new design in terms of its sensitivity, accuracy, processing time etc.)
•
What do we want to measure? (e.g. time, storage size, current, cost, sensitivity, accuracy etc.)
•
How do we perform the measurement? (e.g. built prototype then measure directly or indirectly the sensitivity of the system by following the equation suggested by person X in paper/book Y).
•
What are the tools (e.g. simulation software) or equipment (e.g. oscilloscope, robot prototype etc.) required for the experiment?
•
How are the measurements going to be recorded? What is the procedure of the experiment?
•
What error, situations, or part of the procedure that we design that could interfere with the measurements and how we could overcome them?
•
How do we analyze the result of the experiment? What kind of statistical tools/calculations/graphs/tables/figures could we used in order to make the data meaningful?
Research methodology describes how we conduct our experiment and NOT how we conduct our project.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
By answering point (e) in methodology section, we should now have the results of the study/experiments in the forms of graphs or tables that summarize our measurements (data). At this stage of the research process, we are expected to discuss the results. Examples of points of discussion are:
•
Statement of how the variable of interest changes with the change of another variable and whether the trend is expected.
•
Academic interpretation of the result (i.e. with proof, comparison with other works, intelligent guess).
•
Significance (its impact to the world) and implication of findings.
•
Possible applications.
